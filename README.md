## Hi everybody ðŸ‘‹ Fathimath Thaliyil here.
I hold a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering and started my career as a teaching faculty member in India. Since 2019, I have been living in Germany, where I completed an intensive Web Development Bootcamp at NEUE FISCHE in August 2024.

During the bootcamp, my team and I created "TrailBlazer", an innovative app tailored for outdoor and adventure enthusiasts. The app showcases features such as responsive design and comprehensive CRUD functionality. Take a look at our repository to explore the project!
